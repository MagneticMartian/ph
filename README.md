# ph and rt
A fuzzy finder based cli PornHub and RedTube search engines:
## Discreteness
These scripts allow you to browse your favorite content and not have to worry about a browser or "search history". Obviously your ISP will still know what website you are going to. However, because of https they only see the top level site. Further, if you run a truly private vpn (self-hosted), or you run over everybodies favorite onion, then your search history is just that much more private.
## Ex
```
$ ph
Search: big booty puerto rican goddess
```
Then a display will show a portion of the title with the url next to it. Select which one you want and enjoy.
